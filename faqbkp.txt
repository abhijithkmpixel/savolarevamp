                <p>● The transaction involves three stages consisting of a rights

                    and the distribution of Savola's entire stake of 34.52% in Almarai
                    to eligible Savola shareholders.
                    <br /><br />● All three stages will require EGM and regulatory approvals.
                    <br /><br />● Further material details shall be disclosed once
                    available.

                <h4>What will be the impact on Savola&rsquo;s capital structure?</h4>
                <p>● Savola aims to strengthen its financial position, pay down its
                    debt, and continue to invest in the growth of its portfolio.
                    <br /><br />● The aim is to achieve a more conservative leverage

                <h4>What is the rationale of this transaction?</h4>
                <p>● The rationale is to unlock value. Over the past years, Savola&rsquo;s
                    market capitalization is approximately equal to the market value
                    of its stake in Almarai.

                <p>● The proceeds will be used to strengthen Savola&rsquo;s financial
                    position, pay down its debt, and invest in the growth of its
                    portfolio companies.

                    of its portfolio in addition to enabling the distribution of

                <p>● Almarai has been the most successful investment for Savola Group
                    to date, with the value of Savola&rsquo;s investment in the company
                    increasing more than 100-fold since the initial investment in
                    1991.
                    <br /><br />● Historically, the market capitalization of Savola has closely
                    tracked the market value of the stake held by Savola in Almarai.
                    <br /><br />● Going forward, Savola will focus on investing in the growth of
                    its core food and retail businesses and shareholders will continue
                    to benefit from direct exposure to this growth too.
                    <br /><br />● Savola will also continue to review strategic options to realize
                    value from portfolio companies that demonstrate attractive
                    distribution and monetization potential.
